# TernaryBody
Modeling and Simulation of Scaffolding Proteins

The purpose of this model is to illustrate the complex behavior that arises from scaffolding proteins in the formation of Ternary bodies (protein complexes of 3 separate proteins). Since this not a simple 1-on-1 binding reaction, there are a total of 4 binding reactions (with a matching 4 possible unbinding reactions) that need to occur in order to create a full ternary complex. 

We put this problem in the context of T Cell binding, recognition of tumor presence, and activation in cancer immunotherapy. We simplify the problem by only allowing a certain number of user-defined variables to be changed (while holding the rest constant as they are determined by the experimental setup. This framework was created for matching experimental data and conducting parameter scans to optomize ternary body formation; however, it represents an easily understandable starting point for people interested in understanding the emergent behavior of the biology.
