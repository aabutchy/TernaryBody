# TernaryBody

## Modeling T cell - Antibody - Tumor Cell binding

The purpose of this model is to investigate the formation of T cell bound antibody to Tumor cell antigen. This type of problem is commonly refered to as a Ternary Body model or a Scaffolding Protein model. The purpose of this model is to investigate the kintematics and equilibriu state of a ternary body model in the specific context of T cell - Antibody - Tumor cell targetting.
